        <h2> Hey there! What are you up to this month? </h2>
        <p> If you don't know, we will help you answer that. With monthly, you can track your monthly tasks, learn from your plan and make changes, summarize and anticipate your performance. It's an app that tells you <i>who you are and what you do</i>.</p>
        <div class="log_in_block">
            <button type="button" name="button" onclick="window.location.href='/index.html'">Log In</button>

        <p> We say a person can be changed within a day. What about a month? When you hear it the word, “August,” what do you think of? A type of color? A touch of temperature? An empty page of a calendar? Or something somewhere with someone?</p>

        When I was in college, I knew what it would be like in a few years: taking upper-division classes, studying for GRE, getting ready for graduation, seeking jobs or internships... I also knew what to do in a day: attending this group meeting, working out with friends... Still the sense of meaninglessness was inevitable; afterall I wasn’t motivated because I didn't know what my purpose was.

        We tend to lose ourselves in an ocean of small tiny tasks in a day, diverting and forgeting the purpose in a larger frame. These tasks can be the “specifics” of your to-do list or the unlimited notifications from the reminder. However, Monthly is an overview of yourself. Past, present and future.
