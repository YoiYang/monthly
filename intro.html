        <h2> Hey, what are you up to this month? <br> Yes, <i>this</i> month.</h2>
        <p> If you don't know or not sure how to answer that, Monthly is here to help you. With Monthly, you have an eye in the perspective of months. </p>
        <div class="log_in_block">
            <button type="button" name="button" onclick="window.location.href='/index.html'">Log In</button>
            <button type="button" name="button" onclick="window.location.href='/signup.html'">Create Account</button>
        </div>
        <p> When you hear it the word, “August,” what do you think of? A type of color? A touch of temperature? A page of a calendar? Or something somewhere with someone? Monthly brings you more awareness of your monthly goals. Tracking your monthly tasks, composing ideas for the month, predicting future performances..., you can use it with your own creativity. It's an app that tells you <i>who you are and what you do</i> in a generalized manner.</p>

        When I just got into college, I could see what it is like in two years: attending harder classes, making more friends, finding jobs...
        <p>I also knew what to do in a day: attending some group's meeting, eating out with friends... and so many more.</p>
        <p></p>
        But my life still felt like it was an empty hole; afterall I wasn’t motivated. I lost myself in an abundance of small tiny tasks in a day, checking items of my todo list, at the same time, forgetting the purpose in a larger frame. What I needed is a short-term overview of myself. Past, present and future.
